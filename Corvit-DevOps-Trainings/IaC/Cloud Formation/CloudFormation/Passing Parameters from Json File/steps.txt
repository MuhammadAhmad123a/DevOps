Create s3-bucket.yml
Create param.json

aws cloudformation deploy --template-file s3-bucket.yml --stack-name static-website-12345678 --parameter-overrides file://param.json


Update the Stack using CLI

deploy command update the stack as well. Please note that if you want to review the changeset before executing it you will have to pass a parameter –no-execute-changeset
Once you have reviewed it and are happy with it. Run the deploy command again by removing –no-execute-changeset option. And as expected, this time the changes will execute and your stack is updated.
Here is the command to pass –no-execute-changeset in case you need-

aws cloudformation deploy --template-file s3-bucket.yml --stack-name static-website-12345678 --parameter-overrides file://param.json --no-execute-changeset


Delete the Stack

aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name static-website-12345678
