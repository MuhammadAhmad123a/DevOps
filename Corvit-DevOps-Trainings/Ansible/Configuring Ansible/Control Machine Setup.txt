Installation through Apt on Ubuntu Machine
For installing Ansible you have to configure PPA on your machine.
(A personal package archive (PPA) is a repository that hosts software packages built and maintained by individuals or groups and made available for others. 
PPAs are a convenient way to access the latest software versions that are not yet available in the official repositories of the operating system.)


For this, you have to run the following line of code −
$ sudo apt-get update 
$ sudo apt-get install software-properties-common 
$ sudo apt-add-repository ppa:ansible/ansible 
$ sudo apt-get update 
$ sudo apt-get install ansible
$ ansible --version

After running the above line of code, you are ready to manage remote machines through Ansible. 
Just run ansible --version Ansible–version to check the version and just to check whether Ansible was installed properly or not.
