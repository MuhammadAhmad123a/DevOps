In apache-role.yml we have defined the hosts: webservers and called the two roles â€“ install-apache and start-apache.
create apache-role.yml in /etc/ansible/. 
$ sudo nano apache-role.yml  Place the following code 
--- 
- hosts: webservers 
- roles: 
   - {role: install-apache} 
   - {role: start-apache} 

Create Roles

/etc/ansible/roles$ sudo ansible-galaxy init install-apache
/etc/ansible/roles$ sudo ansible-galaxy init start-apache

There is a tasks directory under each role directory and it contains a main.yml.
Configure main.yml of install-apache + start-apache

/etc/ansible/roles/install-apache/tasks$ sudo nano main.yml
/etc/ansible/roles/start-apache/tasks$ sudo nano main.yml

/etc/ansible$ ansible-playbook apache-role.yml

Note : The advantage of breaking the playbook into roles is that anyone who wants to use the Install apache feature can call the Install apache role
