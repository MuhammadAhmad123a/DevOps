In tomcat-role.yml we have defined the hosts: webservers and called the two roles â€“ install-tomcat and start-tomcat.
create tomcat-role.yml in /etc/ansible/. 
$ sudo nano tomcat-role.yml. Place the following code 
--- 
- hosts: webservers 
- roles: 
   - {role: install-tomcat} 
   - {role: start-tomcat} 

Create Roles

/etc/ansible/roles$ sudo ansible-galaxy init install-tomcat
/etc/ansible/roles$ sudo ansible-galaxy init start-tomcat

There is a tasks directory under each role directory and it contains a main.yml.
Configure main.yml of install-tomcat + start-tomcat

/etc/ansible/roles/install-tomcat/tasks$ sudo nano main.yml
/etc/ansible/roles/start-tomcat/tasks$ sudo nano main.yml

/etc/ansible$ ansible-playbook tomcat-role.yml

Note : The advantage of breaking the playbook into roles is that anyone who wants to use the Install tomcat feature can call the Install Tomcat role
