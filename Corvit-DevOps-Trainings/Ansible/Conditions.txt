Conditionals are used where one needs to run a specific step based on a condition.

--- 
#Tsting 
- hosts: all 
   vars: 
      test1: "Hello" 
   tasks: 
      - name: Testing Ansible variable 
      debug: 
         msg: "Equals" 
         when: test1 == "Hello"


In this case, Equals will be printed as the test1 variable is equal as mentioned in the when condition. 
when can be used with a logical OR and logical AND condition as in all the programming languages.
