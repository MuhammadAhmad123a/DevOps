- hosts : <your hosts> 
- vars:
  tomcat_port : 8080


# In the above example, we have defined a variable name tomcat_port and assigned the value 8080 to that variable and can use that in your playbook wherever needed.

# Now taking a reference from the example shared

block: 
   - name: Install Tomcat artifacts 
      action: > 
      yum name = "demo-tomcat-1" state = present 
      register: Output 
          
   always: 
      - debug: 
         msg: 
            - "Install Tomcat artifacts task ended with message: {{Output}}" 
            - "Installed Tomcat artifacts - {{Output.changed}}" 

Here, the output is the variable used.

Let us walk through all the keywords used in the above code −

    block − Ansible syntax to execute a given block.

    name − Relevant name of the block - this is used in logging and helps in debugging that which all blocks were successfully executed.

    action − The code next to action tag is the task to be executed. The action again is a Ansible keyword used in yaml.

    register − The output of the action is registered using the register keyword and Output is the variable name which holds the action output.

    always − Again a Ansible keyword , it states that below will always be executed.

    msg − Displays the message.


Usage of variable - {{Output}}

This will read the value of variable Output. Also as it is used in the msg tab, it will print the value of the output variable.

Additionally, you can use the sub properties of the variable as well. Like in the case checking {{Output.changed}} whether the output got changed and accordingly use it.
