Attaching the example output just to make one understand how we used the stdout_lines in the with_items command.

#Tsting 
- hosts: tomcat-node 
   tasks: 
      - name: Install Apache 
      shell: "ls *.war" 
      register: output 
      args: 
         chdir: /opt/ansible/tomcat/demo/webapps 
      
      - file: 
         src: '/opt/ansible/tomcat/demo/webapps/{{ item }}' 
         dest: '/users/demo/vivek/{{ item }}' 
         state: link 
      with_items: "{{output.stdout_lines}}"

Blocks

The playbook in totality is broken into blocks. The smallest piece of steps to execute is written in block. 
Writing the specific instruction in blocks helps to segregate functionality and handle it with exception handling if needed.

Example of blocks is covered in variable usage,exception handling and loops above.
